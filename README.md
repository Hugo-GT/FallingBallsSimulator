# FallingBallsSimulator
This is a simulator of a game where there are balls that alternate between 2 paths. One path takes 6 seconds to complete and the other takes 7 seconds to complete. You must catch the balls when they fall outside of the limits if you don't you lose. When you catch a ball you must put it back at the top so that it starts over.
