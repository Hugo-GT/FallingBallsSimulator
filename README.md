# Falling Balls Simulator

A simple web-based game where a ball falls from the top of the screen and must be caught using the 'A' key. If the ball is not caught, the game is lost. Press 'W' to start the game and to drop the ball back to the top after catching it. A new ball is added every 30 seconds, and you have 10 seconds to catch it. If any ball is not caught within this time, the game is over.
